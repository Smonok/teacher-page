            <p class="text"> I am the <b>Computer Science & Coding teacher</b> for the lower school at University
                Academy. I
                earned my
                Bachelor's degree in African and African American Studies with a focus on Arabic and Islamic Studies
                from the
                University of Kansas. Upon completion of my degree I earned a certificate to teach English as a foreign
                language.<br><br>
                I began substitute teaching with University Academy in 2014. In 2015, I was hired as a teaching
                assistant
                for
                UA. I stepped in as the lower school computer teacher in March, 2016. Over the past 5 years I have built
                everlasting relationships with our students. I was born and raised on the east side Kansas City, MO. I
                attended
                KCPS schools up through 8th grade. I am familiar with many of the difficulties students have to deal
                with living
                within the inner-city.<br><br>
                It can be hard to relate, but I think it is definitely a strength I have with the children and the
                hardworking
                community we live within. I know the relentlessness and persistence every student possesses, because I
                possess
                it and I plan to instill this belief into their learning.<br><br>
                In 2016, I implemented a Coding curriculum for the elementary school. The students did very well taking
                on the
                challenge. This year is our students in 4th and 5th grade will work to complete the 4th course on <a
                        href="code.org">Code.org</a>.
                Along with their coding, students focus, in these grade levels, will turn to creating things, as we
                introduce
                robots, arts and many other subjects to the coding realm. There is an algorithm for everything, and our
                students
                have the information, in this day and age, to pair all that available knowledge with a spark of
                creativity. They
                are in the forefront of a technologically savvy world, and the skills they learn from this curriculum
                are
                multivalent. Students will use visual-based coding to build lines of code for computer programs. With
                these
                foundational studies of coding, students could build codes to program robots, cure diseases or
                life-changing
                apps.
